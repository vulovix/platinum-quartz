Break down {} into actionable development tasks.

#### Tasks

### Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] **T001** [Task description] → `path/to/file`
- [ ] **T002** [Task description] → `path/to/file`

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] **T003** [Task description] → `path/to/file`
- [ ] **T004** [P] [Task - can run in parallel] → `path/to/file`
- [ ] **T005** [P] [Task - can run in parallel] → `path/to/file`

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] **T006** [Task description] → `path/to/file`

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish
- [ ] **T007** Write tests for [component]
- [ ] **T008** Add error handling
- [ ] **T009** Update documentation

**Legend:**
- [P] = Can run in parallel with other [P] tasks
- → `path` = File to create/modify

**Dependencies:**
- T003 depends on T001, T002
- T006 depends on T003, T004, T005

**Estimated effort:** [X hours/days]

Rules:
- Each task should be completable in <2 hours
- Include exact file paths
- Mark parallel opportunities with [P]
- Order by dependencies
